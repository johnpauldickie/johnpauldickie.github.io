*The University of Lincoln: A Research-Engaged and Collaborative Community, with
Dr Karin Crawford.* ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFbDzA55ROI))</small>

Last year, I was first introduced to the [Change Agents
Network](https://can.jiscinvolve.org/wp/) at Jisc as a student and volunteer SU
officer when the [University of Lincoln](http://edeu.lincoln.ac.uk/event/jisc/)
hosted itâ€™s annual meet-up. I was asked to co-present the keynote at the start
of the conference on [â€˜The University of Lincoln: a research-engaged and
collaborative
communityâ€™](https://can.jiscinvolve.org/wp/files/2016/06/University-of-Lincoln-Keynote.pdf) with Dr Karin Crawford, the Director of the Educational Development and
Enhancement Unit, Lincolnâ€™s former learning and teaching unit, following our own
experiences of the student as producer ethos.

### Supporting Effective Partnershipsâ€™ was the theme at this yearâ€™s [Jisc Change Agentsâ€™ Network 2017](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/academic-skills-engagement-team/student-engagement/can2017/), hosted by the University of Exeter.

The conference programme this year was across two days with a mixture of
parallel presentations and workshops as well as keynotes.

One thing that stood out strong this year is that **partnership is alive and
well** â€” between staff and students or between universities and studentsâ€™
unions.

The University of Exeter has a strong culture and passion for [Students as
Change Agents](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/academic-skills-engagement-team/student-engagement/change/),
as noted with their project, throughout the institution which set the tone for
the rest of the two days.

For me, I picked up some really good ideas and best practice which I have taken
away from the event, two examples from Exeter; Student Quality Champions and
online student-staff partnership boards.

Student quality champions are the Deputy Subject Chairs, elected by students,
who have responsibility in a particular area for quality matters so staff have
one student contact to discuss changes to programmes or surveys as well as sit
on Academic Offences panels for students in other departments.

Student-staff partnership boards take place within the College of Life and
Environmental Sciences at the University of Exeter, where the college is based
across three different campuses, therefore typical feedback and partnership work
previously has struggled until video conference capabilities enabled partnership
boards to be launched including Exeter Studentsâ€™ Guild, Falmouth and Exeter
Studentsâ€™ Union, staff from the college and student subject chairs from the
various different departments.

This approach is very interesting in closing the feedback and communication loop
between students and representatives across different campuses, something which
I found useful while looking at distance learning representation.

### The Power of Partnerships; using data collaboratively to enhance the student experience.

As part of one of the sessions in the conference programme, a team from the
University of Lincoln and University of Lincoln Studentsâ€™ Union delivered a
workshop on using survey data in partnership to help enhance the student
experience.

The specific example used was our Module Evaluations, which are facilitated by
the Studentsâ€™ Union (promotion and operational running) on behalf of the
University. Student Academic Reps then use anonymised comments in partnership
with staff to make a positive impact on the student experience.

This yearâ€™s Jisc CAN conference was thoroughly interesting and thought provoking
with lots of good examples of best practice shared around between sector
colleagues.
