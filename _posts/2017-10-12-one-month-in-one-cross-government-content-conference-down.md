I [joined](https://medium.com/@johnpauldickie/on-the-move-joining-gds-e382bc3cc82c)
the [Government Digital Service (GDS)](http://gov.uk/gds) just over one month
ago. Iâ€™m sort of trying to still figure out how a) itâ€™s already been a month, b)
how much has happened in that space of time. 5 September feels like a long time
ago.

Iâ€™m part of a small but perfectly formed
[t](http://twitter.com/laurabillings)[e](https://twitter.com/SueDavis68)[a](https://twitter.com/Ben_Hazell)[m](http://twitter.com/johnpauldickie)
who look after training and learning needs of the cross-government content
community, aptly named the â€˜content community teamâ€™ based in the GOV.UK team.

Safe to say, itâ€™s been a pretty amazing start.

### Communities are hugely important â€” not just to network, but to learn and be inspired by others

One of the best ways to understand a different community in government is to
visit one of their meet-ups. My first was the cross-government design meetup,
which happened during London Design Festival.

Many things were shared about what is taking place in terms of service design
across government to help users, for us â€” the citizen ([remembering civil
servants are users
too!](https://twitter.com/LouiseDowne/status/909794643042275328)).

Services being designed and put together which can help people know more about
[floods in their
area](https://twitter.com/LouiseDowne/status/909786495451631616), [registering
and booking an appointment at a GP
surgery](https://twitter.com/LouiseDowne/status/909791576502755328) ultimately
taking out the hassle when moving and making the complicated simpler such as the
[personal tax account](https://twitter.com/JoCArthur/status/909787784520577025).

### Bringing the community together provides ultimate knowledge exchange

Yesterday was the sixth edition of ConCon â€” the cross-government content
conference. Over 240 content designers from 56 departments and agencies â€” from
the big central government departments to small support agencies â€” attended
ConCon. They came from all over the country to learn from one another. The
tickets were so popular they sold out faster than a band playing at the O2
(maybe not that much but it wasnâ€™t far off).

Sessions ranging from accessibility, product management, data, policy, user
journey mapping and clear writing â€” just to name a few. It was also about
reflecting where the community was at in terms of skills, [mapping
capability](https://twitter.com/1mikeowen/status/918054434860617728) against the
Digital, Data and Technology profession [â€˜Content designer: skills they

There will be a longer detailed blog post coming up in the next couple of weeks
about the day on one of the GDS blogs but to be involved in pulling together and
running ConCon6 was such a rewarding experience to see the reaction and feedback
coming through on Twitter, knowing the impact it will make back in departments
and agencies.

As I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/johnpauldickie/status/918170326604963841)
yesterday, it wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the community helping on the
day to make sure it happened, speaking and running workshops but mainly
attending the conference. The people make the community what it is.

### Thereâ€™s always more to learn, always someone to be trained.

ConCon6 has finished but thats not just the learning experiences. GDS runs
training nearly every week of the year for [content designers, press officers
and statisticians](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/tag/training/) to help learn how to
write for GOV.UK but more advanced training on [pair
writing](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/21/it-takes-2-how-we-use-pair-writing/),
training others in [clear
writing](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/15/clear-writing-training-helps-the-whole-organisation/)
and user journeys.

I pull all this together â€” the logistics of making sure people who need
training, get trained, by a trainer, with the right training resources
afterwards. Iâ€™m lucky to work with a great team â€” which I mentioned those at the
start of this post.
